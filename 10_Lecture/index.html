    <h1>Object.freeze() and Object.seal()</h1>

    <h2>Object.seal()</h2>

    <strong>Syntex</strong>
    <b>Object.seal(obj)</b>
    <p>
      The Object.seal() static method seals an object. Sealing an object
      prevents extensions and makes existing properties non-configurable. A
      sealed object has a fixed set of properties: new properties cannot be
      added, existing properties cannot be removed, their enumerability and
      configurability cannot be changed, and its prototype cannot be
      re-assigned. Values of existing properties can still be changed as long as
      they are writable. seal() returns the same object that was passed in.
    </p>


    <strong>Syntex</strong>
    <b>Object.freeze(obj)</b>
    <p>
      The Object.freeze() static method freezes an object. Freezing an object
      prevents extensions and makes existing properties non-writable and
      non-configurable. A frozen object can no longer be changed: new properties
      cannot be added, existing properties cannot be removed, their
      enumerability, configurability, writability, or value cannot be changed,
      and the object's prototype cannot be re-assigned. freeze() returns the
      same object that was passed in. <strong>Freezing an object is the highest
      integrity level that JavaScript provides.</strong>
