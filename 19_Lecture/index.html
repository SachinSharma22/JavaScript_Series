    <h1>Higher Order Functions</h1>

    <h3>What are Higher Order Functions?</h3>
    <p>
      Higher order functions (HOFs) in JavaScript are functions that can do at
      least one of the following: 
      <ul>
          <li>
            Accept other functions as arguments. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Return a function as a result.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Core concepts of Higher Order Functions</h2>
       <h3> 1. Accepting Functions as Arguments</h3>
       <p> Higher order functions can accept other functions as arguments. This allows for dynamic behavior, where the behavior of the higher order function can be customized based on the function passed as an argument.</p>
       <h2>2. Returning Functions.</h2>
        <p>
            Higher order functions can also return functions. This enables the creation of functions dynamically based on certain conditions or parameters.
        </p>
        <h3>3. Abstraction</h3>
<p>
    Higher order functions promote abstraction by encapsulating common patterns or behaviors into reusable functions. This leads to cleaner and more modular code.
